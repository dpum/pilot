# DPUM - Session 01 - Problem Solving 101

This is a live guide that will be updated with our findings regarding this matter. There is no silver bullet here, each one/group should evolve it process. Nonetheless there are some guidelines that will certanily help you.

### Solving a problem:
-------------------------------
For this guideline the max time allocated to each problem is 25 minutes. Our suggestion on how to spend the 25 minutes would be:
* Allocate the first 5 minutes to understand the problem and ask yourself clarifying questions. If the problem is simple enough then writing test cases may be done in this step.
* Spend the next 10 minutes solving the problem on paper & pen/pencil.
* By now the implementation should be clear. Spend the rest of the time implementing it.
* Take the time to understand the solution and write a record about the problem somewhere (suggestion: on your developer journal).
* Record your progress somewhere (if you use git and add a commit to your solutions repo that will be automatic)
* Revisit the question in the future (next week for example).
