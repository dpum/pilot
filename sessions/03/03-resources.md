# DPUM - Session 03 - Resources

This session introduces problems that build upon applications/corolaries of graph traversal algorithms. In order to solve them we must be comfortable with graph traversals and also acquire some knowledge on the most common applications. Our first recomendation would be to read content about this topic on *The Algorithm Design Manual* (sections 5.7 - 5.10). Additionally there is plenty of content available online, our suggestion would be the *HackerEarth* content:

* [HackerEarth - Biconnected Components](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/biconnected-components/tutorial/)

* [HackerEarth - Articulation Points and Bridges](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/articulation-points-and-bridges/tutorial/)

* [HackerEarth - Topological Sort](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/topological-sort/tutorial/)
