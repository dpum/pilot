# DPUM - Session 03 - Tasks

Some cool things that could be added to the repo:

* Implementations of applications of BFS on undirected graphs: Finding paths, Connected components, Two-colouring graphs

* Implementations of applications of BFS on directed graphs: Finding cycles, Articulation vertices

* Implementations of applications of DFS: Topological sorting, Strongly connected components

* Enhancements to the problem set.
